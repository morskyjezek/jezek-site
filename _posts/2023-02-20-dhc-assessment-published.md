I was pleased last week to see the [release](https://www.clir.org/2023/02/clir-announces-publication-of-the-amplifying-unheard-voices-program-evaluation-report/) of our assessment report
on the Digitizing Hidden Collections: Amplifying Unheard Voices grant program. The report is titled _Evaluating Equity and Inclusion in Cultural Heritage Grantmaking: CLIR‚Äôs Amplifying Unheard Voices Program_.
The report was co-authored by [Ricky Punzalan](https://rpunzalan.com/)
and me, and it was published by the Council on Library 
and Information Resources (CLIR). As I noted on twitter:

In their description of the report, CLIR writes:

> This report summarizes a yearlong program assessment of "Amplifying Unheard Voices," a major revision of CLIR's Digitizing Hidden Collections grant program. The revision sought to expand the reach and appeal of the program to a broader range of institutions, including independent and community organizations, and to emphasize the digitization of historical materials that tell the stories of groups underrepresented in the digital historical record. Significant changes were made to the application structure, new applicant support resources were created, eligibility was expanded to Canada, and new thematic emphases and program values were added. The assessment was based on a series of qualitative data-gathering activities that included stakeholder groups and staff. Through surveys and interviews of applicants, inquirers, proposal reviewers, and staff, the authors provide a holistic view of the program, offer a series of recommendations, and identify areas for further attention.

The [full report and accompanying data are available from CLIR as a pdf](https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/dhc-auv-assessment/).
