I'm happy to announce that next fall,
I'll be joining the faculty of the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) [School of Information](https://si.umich.edu/) (aka UMSI)
as a Clinical Assistant Professor with a teaching focus on digital curation,
digital preservation, and archives. The appointment technically begins during the summer. 

## New Teaching Opportunities

I'm looking forward to this exciting opportunity to be part of
the cutting-edge curriculum, which is pioneering the development of 
digital skills for early-career librarians and archivists, among other
information professionals. 
While I have some concerns about value conflicts with the outdated, elitist culture academia, as well as the overheated prestige economy, 
I outweighed these against
the opportunity to facilitate learning for archivists and digital curators
in training.
Teaching in a program like the one at UMSI is a chance to build out a digital archives and curation curriculum
that is built on the cutting-edge technical and programming foundations
that UMSI has built up over the last decade.
