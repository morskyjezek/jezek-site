I'm happy to announce that next fall,
I'll be joining the faculty of the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) [School of Information](https://si.umich.edu/) (aka UMSI)
as a Clinical Assistant Professor with a teaching focus on digital curation,
digital preservation, and archives. The appointment technically begins during the summer. 

## Old Academia, New Teaching Opportunities

I'm looking forward to this exciting opportunity to be part of
the cutting-edge curriculum at UMSI, which is pioneering the development of 
digital skills for early-career librarians and archivists, among other
information professionals. 
While I have some concerns about returning to academia&mdash;particularly its elitist, medieval hierarchies and governance structures (some might say outdated),
as well as its overheated (and under-acknowledged) [prestige economy](https://katinarogers.com/2018/11/15/the-problem-with-prestige/)&mdash;I decided these would be outweighed by
the opportunity to facilitate training for archivists and digital curators. Those who know me may also recognize that I have had a longstanding
relationship to the University of Michigan, which is not only a great university
but also my alma mater.

Teaching in a program like the one at UMSI is a chance to build out a digital archives and curation curriculum
that is built on the cutting-edge technical and programming foundations
that UMSI has built up over the last decade. That is something to which
I have already contributed in my teaching
at the University of Maryland, where I began building a curriculum of
curation skills and tools for digital collections, and I look forward to
expanding those learning opportunities in this new role.
