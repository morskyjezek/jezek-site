<p>The preceding pieces, listed in reverse chronological order, are links
to Web publications from my tenure at the National Endowment for
the Humanities (2013&ndash;2018) and the Library of Congress (2018&ndash;2020).
These aren&rsquo;t complete without a few thank yous!
I was the primary author of the NEH pieces, but they represent significant
collaborative efforts and received substantial support from many NEH grantees
and NEH editors, particularly Ralph Canevali, Cathleen Tefft, Adriana Cutler,
Joel Wurl, and Leah Weinryb Grohsgal. The posts published at Library of Congress
were much stronger with input from, and frequent co-authorship with, Kate Murray,
Trevor Owens, Aly DesRochers, Jaime Mears, Chase Dooley, Grace Thomas, and Carlyn Osborn.</p>
