## The Cimb&aacute;l (Cimbalom) in Moravia: Cultural Organology and Interpretive Communities

_Completed 2008_
    
**Co-Chairs: Judith Becker and Amy K. Stillman**
    
This dissertation advances the concept of cultural organology through a detailed study 
of the <em>cimb√°l</em> (cimbalom) as it is played in Moravia (Czech Republic). Organology 
is often understood as the description and classification of musical instruments; however, 
cultural organology takes a broader approach that considers instruments as evocative 
objects that connect musical, experiential, and cultural knowledge. Musical instruments 
are artifacts that focus musical thought and tangibly center personal and collective 
musical experience. Instrumental performance practices enliven instruments from 
material artifacts into objects that open up and center musical worlds. Instruments imply 
a player, history, pedagogy, repertory, audience, and ethos&mdash;all of which constitute an 
interpretive community. Viewed through a lens of cultural organology, the cimbalom 
discloses musical and cultural aspects of Moravian interpretive communities.

The dissertation develops a framework of object-centered ethnography and 
applies this approach in a series of case studies centered on the Moravian cimbalom. The 
study begins with a narrative description of a concert in south Moravia that opens up a 
theoretical discussion of ways that musical instruments are understood (Chapter 1). This 
is followed by an introduction to the cimbalom as it has developed in cultural and 
musical contexts in Moravia (Chapter 2). Four detailed case studies follow that 
demonstrate the way that the cimbalom centers interpretive communities and is 
understood in specific, Moravian ways: nineteenth-century efforts to transcribe and 
sponsor performances (Chapter 3); the relationship of the cimbalom to folk culture and 
Communist ideology, particularly as experienced through urban folk groups and 
orchestral radio ensembles (Chapter 4); a history of cimbalom teaching in Moravia and 
an investigation of cognitive and kinesthetic concepts of playing the instrument (Chapter 
5); and a study of the cimbalom&rsquo;s recent use in world music as heard in the performances 
of two contemporary Moravian artists (Chapter 6). This dissertation offers a detailed 
view of the relationship of contemporary Moravian folk music performance with 
nineteenth-century models, investigates the relationship of traditional music ensembles 
before and during the Communist period, and illustrates the value of an object-centered 
approach to musical ethnography and cultural organology.
