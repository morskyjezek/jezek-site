I am a scholar and archivist who researches digital preservation, recordkeeping and recordmaking, and the anthropology of music. My music research focuses on music cultures of Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and the United States centering on music learning and cognition, musical instruments, and digital and material cultures. In information studies, I have focused on user practices in sound archives, federal records management policy, and digital collections management. {% capture awards-summary %}I have received numerous awards for my work.

## Approaches
{: no_toc}

I employ a combination of interpretive and qualitative approaches in my work. 
As a researcher trained in ethnography and fieldwork, I emphasize the importance
of gaining a detailed and grounded perspective based on local understandings, 
whether this is an organizational setting like an archive or a more distributed
domain, such as musical performance or policy space. In my work, I therefore use a variety of methods, including archival research, interviews, ethnographic fieldwork, and analysis of government documents and policies.
