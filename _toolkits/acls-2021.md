## Background

The American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) offers many fellowship competitions. Most of these are designed for particular groups or disciplines in the humanities. Some are open to dissertation writers, postdoctoral scholars, or early faculty, and some are focused on different initiatives, such as promoting scholarship in a certain area, serving underrepresented groups, gaining digital skills, developing careers in the public sector, or more. The ACLS also administers application and selection for various societies or private funders, such as Luce, Mellon, and others. You should read through the list of current offerings to see what might be best suited to your interests and needs (last bullet point).
