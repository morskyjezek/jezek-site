# Information about this site

This is the git repository that generates my personal portfolio site. The site is a jekyll-based site themed with mmistakes/minimal-mistakes. A prior version piloted in 2020 and published in 2021 was based on the academic-pages template (https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), but I updated this in April 2021 to use new formatting features available in the full theme.
