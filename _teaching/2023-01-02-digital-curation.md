This graduate course covered foundational theoretical, conceptual, and practical problems in digital curation. Students explored these problems in practice through hands-on projects. This course understood digital curation as the _active involvement of information professionals in the management of digital data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to science, scholarship and education_. To prepare students to work in this growing field, the course aimed to provide a strong grounding in the fundamentals of digital preservation and migration; an understanding of the data practices and needs of researchers; trends and obstacles to data sharing and reuse; and experience making data fit for preservation and range of different users and uses. The course drew on current research information science, archival and library service, and cognate fields.
