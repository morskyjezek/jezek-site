I designed the syllabus for this graduate-level course on bibliograpy and research methods for advanced, music-focused research. The course was designed to offer an overview of the major reference resources and concepts for designing and carrying out music-focused research. The 2012 syllabus is available [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jajohnst/courses/mhm503-2012/).
