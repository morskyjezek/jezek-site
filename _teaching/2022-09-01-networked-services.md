This graduate course explored skills for developing, manging, describing, and presenting cultural heritage materials in a networked environment. The course follows the move away from centralized, commercial systems such as Library Management Systems (LMS) toward more agile, component-based solutions and open data standards. This move to network-based and interlinked solutions has coincided with a rapid growth in free and open source software (FOSS) and platforms. Among the activities students learned in the course are creation, management, and updating of XML-based and JSON-based metadata using open tools (such as Python), and the setup, configuration, and management of a networked service (such as the Omeka S platform).
