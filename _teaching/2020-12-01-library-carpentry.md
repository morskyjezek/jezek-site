I am a certified instructor in The Carpentries, a method of teaching that emphasizes technical skill-building and live-coding in an inclusive and accessible learning environment. I focus on [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org), which presents an active curriculum for librarians to expand their digital skills.<!-- more --> I became involved with this teaching approach in 2018, while at the Library of Congress, and I have since taught workshops in-person and online, for learners at the Smithsonian, American University, Clemson University, and the U.S. Geological Survey. 

Here are the workshops I've taught: 

* [2021 workshop at Ohio State University](https://morskyjezek.github.io/2021-05-24-osu-online/)
