I am a certified instructor in The Carpentries, an inclusive and engaged method of teaching technical skills with open, foundational tools in a live-coding learning environment. I focus on [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org), which presents an active curriculum for librarians to expand their digital skills.<!-- more --> I became involved with this teaching approach in 2018, while at the Library of Congress, and I have since taught workshops in-person and online, for learners at the Smithsonian, American University, Clemson University, and the U.S. Geological Survey. 

I teach all of the core tools and softwares that the Carpentries features, including regular expressions, best practices for organizing data in spreadsheets, basic and advanced usage of the Bash shell for research, metadata cleaning and transformation with Open Refine, and basics of data processing and visualization using Python (and the Pandas module). 

Here are the workshops I've taught:
